# SCP
Simple Concordance Program

Simple Concordance Program (SCP) is designed help you 
look through computer readable text files for the 
occurrence of key words. When each word is found SCP 
will display the context in which the word is used, 
and also gives a reference to where that word occurs 
in the text. SCP will show the vocabulary used by the 
author and the frequency with which words are used. 
These can be displayed in alphabetic order, as in a 
dictionary, or according to their frequency of use. 
SCP will also produce a word frequency profile and 
some statistical properties of the texts.
